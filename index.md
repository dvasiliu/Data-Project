You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dvasiliu/Data-Project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The following is python syntax (highlighted)
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
```

The following is R syntax

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(dplyr)

x <- c(1,2,3,4)
y <- 2*x
```

Here we have an equation (LateX syntax):

![\Large \sqrt{2x+1}=\frac{2x}{x+1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sqrt{2x+1}=\frac{2x}{x+1})

$$\sqrt{2x+1}=\frac{2x}{x+1}$$


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dvasiliu/Data-Project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
